# How easy can it be to deploy a static website on the Internet Computer?

This repo is a basic static html website with the purpose of deploying onto the Internet Computer blockchain through a service that connects to Github for deployment. The service is called Internet Computer Services. 

I'm not affiliated with the project and just trying it out.
