# How easy can it be to deploy a static website on the Internet Computer?

This repo is a basic static html website with the purpose of deploying onto the Internet Computer blockchain through a service that connects to Github for deployment. The service is called Internet Computer Services. 

I'm not affiliated with the project and just trying it out. 

Steps
1) Go to https://console.internetcomputerservices.com/

2) Click Create Dapp

3) Select Static Website

4) Click Connect for the repo that you want to deploy

5) Enter deployment settings

6) And watch the deployment progress (very similar to a Netlify deploy)

7) And voila! Site deployed! https://c7pdz-piaaa-aaaam-abhfq-cai.ic0.app/

I went back to the dashboard and noticed that a canister was created as well. I have not allocated any cycles to the canister so I'm not sure how long the site would stay online for. 

The experience was pretty good, it was very easy to deploy, just like Netlify. 

I think it will be pretty cool if they can add on the feature to link up domain names. That might drive further adoption.
